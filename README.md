# BAMAZON

## Overview

The bamazon-app is an Amazon-like storefront which takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. If requested it also provides the summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

## Technologies and packages used

The app uses 
* MySQl packages for data storage
 
* Inquirer npm packages for data input

* Node.js

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Once the js file is loaded, the user follows the instructions and answers the questions: he enters the item_id he is looking to purchase and then add the quantity. If there is enough quantity to process the order then his total is displayed and the stock quantity is updated. Otherwise, the "Insufficent quantity" will be displayed and he exits the app.
